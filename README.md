### Frontend
- **Pages**: Includes pages for user registration, login, forum homepage, post details, and user profile.
- **Interactivity**: Supports form submission for posts/comments, like/dislike functionality, and category filtering.

### Database Design
- **ERD**: Entity Relationship Diagram to define the database schema.
- **Tables**: Designed for users, posts, comments, categories, likes/dislikes.

### Docker
- **Dockerfile**: For setting up the application's environment and dependencies.
- **Container Management**: Includes scripts for building and running the container.
