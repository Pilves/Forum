Project Structure
Backend:
Framework: Choose a backend framework that supports SQLite (e.g., Flask, Django, Express.js)
Database: SQLite for data management.
Authentication: User authentication with secure password storage.
Session Management: Use UUIDs for session management.
API Endpoints: For user registration, login, post creation, post liking/disliking, comments, category association, and filtering.
Frontend:
Pages: User registration, login, forum homepage, post details, user profile.
Interactivity: Form submission for posts/comments, like/dislike functionality, category filtering.
Database Design:
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to define the database schema.
Tables for users, posts, comments, categories, likes/dislikes.
Docker:
Dockerfile: For setting up the application's environment and dependencies.
Container Management: Scripts for building and running the container.
Tasks Breakdown
Database Design:

Design an ERD.
Create tables for users, posts, comments, categories, and reactions.
Define relationships (foreign keys, one-to-many, many-to-many).
Backend Development:

Set up the backend framework.
Configure SQLite with the backend.
Implement user authentication and session management.
Develop API endpoints for all required functionalities.
Implement password encryption for secure storage.
Frontend Development:

Create the user interface with HTML/CSS/JS.
Connect the frontend with the backend through API calls.
Ensure responsiveness and interactivity.
Like/Dislike Functionality:

Backend logic to handle like/dislike.
Frontend components for users to like/dislike posts and comments.
Post Filtering:

Backend logic for filtering posts by categories.
Frontend components to apply filters.
Dockerize the Application:

Write the Dockerfile for the application.
Create Docker images and test the containers.
Write documentation on how to build and run the containers.
Bonus Functionality (Optional):

Search feature implementation.
File upload feature for users.
User profile page with editable information.
Testing:

Write unit and integration tests for the backend.
Conduct front-end testing, including forms and interactivity.
Test the Docker deployment process.
Documentation:

Write a README.md detailing the project setup and usage.
Comment code appropriately for maintainability.
Version Control:

Initialize a Git repository.
Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages.
Execution Plan
Sprint 0: Project setup, including initializing the repository and Docker environment.
Sprint 1: Database design and backend setup.
Sprint 2: Implement authentication, session management, and core functionalities.
Sprint 3: Frontend development and connection to the backend.
Sprint 4: Like/dislike functionality and post filtering.
Sprint 5: Docker containerization and deployment.
Sprint 6: Implement bonus features if time allows and final testing.
Sprint 7: Documentation and final touches.
Project Management
Use an agile methodology, with regular stand-ups to discuss progress and obstacles.
Track tasks using a project management tool (e.g., JIRA, Trello).
Maintain a backlog of tasks and prioritize them for each sprint.
Next Steps
If this project structure and task breakdown align with your vision for the "Literary Lions" forum, the next step would be to start on the database design or backend setup, depending on your preference. Let me know which part you would like to begin with, or if there are any specific tasks you'd like to focus on first.
